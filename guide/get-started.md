## Step 1: Install the Arcanepad Desktop App
Install Arcanepad desktop application on your PC. Download it [here](https://github.com/imvenx/arcanepad-releases/releases)

## Step 2: Get the Arcanepad Mobile App
Next, equip your android mobile device with the Arcanepad app [here](https://github.com/imvenx/arcanepad-releases-android/releases)

<!-- ## Step 3: Pair the two devices with the Arcane Code
On the desktop app you will see the "Arcane Code". Open the mobile app, and insert this code.
If this doesn't work try disabling the VPN, or enabling "Local Network sharing" on your VPN settings. 
If that still doesn't work, try adding Arcanepad as an exception on your firewall.  -->

## Step 3: Pair the Devices Using the Arcane Code

To establish a connection between your desktop and mobile device, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Arcane Code**: On your desktop application, look for the "Arcane Code." This code is crucial for pairing your devices.

2. **Enter the Code in the Mobile App**: Launch the ArcanePad app on your mobile device and enter the Arcane Code when prompted.

3. **Troubleshooting Tips**:
   - If the pairing process fails, consider these solutions:
     - **Disable VPN**: Some VPNs may interfere with the connection. Try disabling your VPN and attempt to pair the devices again.
     - **Enable Local Network Sharing in VPN**: If you prefer to keep your VPN enabled, look for an option like "Local Network Sharing" in your VPN settings and enable it.
     - **Firewall Settings**: Firewalls can sometimes block the app. Try adding ArcanePad as an exception in your firewall settings.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully pair your devices using the Arcane Code.
