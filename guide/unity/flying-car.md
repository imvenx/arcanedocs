# Flying Car Game with Arcanepad in Unity

This is an hybrid project. The view is made with Unity, and the gamepad is made with web technologies. 
If you dont know javascript it shouldn't be a problem since most of the logic happens on the view, 
you can easily reimplement the pad in Unity with a little bit of reverse engineering. In the future we
may add the pad implemented in Unity. Anyways if you know a bit of web/javascript
you can benefit from it since the web gamepads load a lot faster than wasm unity/godot builds. Also SVG
is great for doing interactable dynamic UI.
