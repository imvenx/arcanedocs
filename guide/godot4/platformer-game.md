This game has been done using Kenneys free assets, and the Arcanepad library. It is hardcoded to just one player because It would have taken some time to add camera logic for multiple players, but it can certainly be done, it shouldn't too much time to a seasoned godot developer. I may attempt to add this functinality in the future. Also it features an advanced multi-direcional joystick on the gamepad. You are welcome to take this example and expand it, or use it as a base for another game
